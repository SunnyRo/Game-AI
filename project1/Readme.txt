All code are written using python3 #!/usr/bin/python3
We can either run python file using pycharm(window) or terminal
Also task3 using numpy package. Thus make sure you already installed numpy

install numpy:
    1. Terminal: 
            - sudo apt install python3-pip (if you dont have pip3)
            - sudo pip3 install numpy
    2. Pycharm(window)
            - search numpy package https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/installing-uninstalling-and-upgrading-packages.html
Task 1
Run the code:
    - Terminal: python3 Task1.py
    Step 1: You will be asked to enter number of elements (n) for the list
    Step 2: Enter 1 if you want to see execution time or 2 if you want to see if it actually sorts the list
Task 2
Run the code:
    - Terminal: python3 Task2.py
    You will be asked to enter number of disks (n) with n = 2,4,8,16,32,...
Task 3
Run the code:
    - Terminal: python3 Task3.py
    Step 1: You will be asked to enter matrix size (n) with n = 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256,...
    Step 2: Enter 1 if you want to see execution time or 2 if you want to see if it actually works
